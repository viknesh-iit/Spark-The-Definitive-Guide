Chapter 1 What is Spark
**************************************************************
What Is Apache Spark?
	Apache Spark is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer clusters.
What all components and libraries Spark offers/Spark Toolkit
	Structured Streaming
	Advanced Analytics
	Libraries & EcoSystem
	Structured APIs - Datasets/DataFrames/SQL
	Low Level APIs - RDDs/Distributed Variables
Why Spark is a Unified Platform?
	Spark supports a wide range of data analytics tasks, ranging from simple data loading and SQL queries to machine learning and streaming computation, over the same computing engine and with a consistent set of APIs.
What are the persistent Storage systems spark can be used with?
	Azure Storage
	Amazon S3
	Apache Hadoop(Distributed File system)
	Apache Cassandra(key-value stores)
	Apache Kafka(message buses)
Spark packages site?
	https://spark-packages.org/
What are the libraries?
	SQL and structured data (Spark SQL)
	machine learning (MLlib)
	Stream processing (Spark Streaming and the newer Structured Streaming)
	graph analytics (GraphX)
How does distributed processing evolved?
	Processing speed could not change;storage cost keeps reducing
Drawbacks of MapReduce?
	Each pass had to be written as a separate MapReduce job
	This had to be launched separately on the cluster and load the data from scratch
Spark Realease dates
	Spark 1.0 in 2014
	Spark 2.0 in 2016
Where is Structured Streaming used ??	
	Uber and Netflix
